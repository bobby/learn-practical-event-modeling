# Exercise 1, Step 1

The goal of this step is to brainstorm all the events within our
[business process](../../README.md#Use-case). Events are represented
as orange sticky notes that are placed below the Timeline lane, and
are named as verb phrases in the past tense, e.g. "Ride Requested" or
"Vehicle Added".
