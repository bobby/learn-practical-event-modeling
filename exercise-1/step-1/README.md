# Exercise 1, Step 1

The goal of this step is to brainstorm all the events within our
[business process](../../README.md#Use-case). Events are represented
as orange sticky notes that are placed below the Timeline lane, and
are named as verb phrases in the past tense, e.g. "Ride Requested" or
"Vehicle Added".

Add as many events to your modeling canvas as necessary to describe
both the vehicle owner/inventory management and the ride-lifecycle
business processes.  Don't worry about ordering these events or making
mistakes: go broad first, then we'll narrow down and sequence in the
next few steps.
