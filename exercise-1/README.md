# Exercise 1

In this exercise, we'll build our Event Model out to the point of
functioning a bit like a storyboard for a film.  This phase of the
Event Modeling workshop proceeds in 3 steps:

1. First, we'll begin [step 1](./step-1) with a blank Event
   Model, and then proceed by brainstorming our business Events.  We
   won't worry yet about properly ordering/sequencing these
   Events. When you're done, the model should look something like this
   ([png](./step-1/result.png?raw=1) |
   [json export](./step-1/result.json?raw=1)).
2. Next, in [step 2](./step-2), we'll sequence the
   [Events that we brainstormed](./step-2) into a plausable
   business narrative, sort of like the script of a film. When you're
   done, the model should look something like this ([png](./step-2/result.png?raw=1) |
   [json export](./step-2/result.json?raw=1))
3. Finally, in [step 3](./step-3) we'll add Interfaces above our
   Events to visualize what the user will be experiencing at that
   point in the workflow, similar to how a film's storyboard combines
   visuals with key plot points. When you're done, the model should look something like this
   ([png](./step-3/result.png?raw=1) | [json export](./step-3/result.json?raw=1))
