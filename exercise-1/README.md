# Exercise 1

In this exercise, we'll build our Event Model out to the point of
functioning a bit like a storyboard for a film.  This phase of the
Event Modeling workshop proceeds in 3 steps, and the `README.md` for
each step contains detailed instructions for completing that step:

1. First, we'll begin [step 1](./step-1/README.md) with a blank Event
   Model, and then proceed by brainstorming our business Events.  We
   won't worry yet about properly ordering/sequencing these
   Events. When you're done, the model should look something like this
   ([png](./step-1/result.png?raw=1) |
   [json export](./step-1/result.json?raw=1)).
2. Next, in [step 2](./step-2/README.md), we'll sequence the
   [Events that we brainstormed](./step-2) into a plausible
   business narrative, sort of like the script of a film. When you're
   done, the model should look something like this ([png](./step-2/result.png?raw=1) |
   [json export](./step-2/result.json?raw=1))
3. Finally, in [step 3](./step-3/README.md) we'll add Interfaces above our
   Events to visualize what the user will be experiencing at that
   point in the workflow, similar to how a film's storyboard combines
   visuals with key plot points. When you're done, the model should look something like this
   ([png](./step-3/result.png?raw=1) | [json export](./step-3/result.json?raw=1))

## Completing this Exercise with [Evident Design](https://app.evidentstack.com/design)

Create a new Event Model in Evident Design for each step, and follow
the instructions in that step by adding elements to the modeling
canvas.  On the first step, you'll obviously begin with a blank model.
For all subsequent steps, you can
[import](https://docs.evidentstack.com/design-docs/Latest/models/import-export-models.html#import-event-model-json)
the `result.json` of the previous step to get you to a consistent
starting point before proceeding.

## Completing this Exercise with sticky notes or a drawing app

For each step, add components to your modeling canvas to complete the
described outcome.  At the beginning of the next step, check the PNG
of the prior step result (linked above) and ensure your canvas
resembles that consistent starting point before proceeding.
