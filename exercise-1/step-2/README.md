# Exercise 1, Step 2

In the [last step](../step-1), we brainstormed the events in no
particular order.  These include:

* Vehicle Returned
* Vehicle Removed
* Vehicle Added
* Ride Scheduled
* Ride Cancelled
* Rider Dropped Off
* Ride Requested
* Rider Picked Up
* Vehicle Available
* Vehicle Return Requested

The goal of this step is to sequence these events into a plausible
narrative on your modeling canvas.
