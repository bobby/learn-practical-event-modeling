# Exercise 2, Step 2

The outcome of [the previous step](../step-1) was the addition of
Commands to empower our users to affect changes in the system. In
order for our users to know what changes to make, we'll need to inform
them about the state of the system via Read Models.

The goal of this step is to add in the Read Models. Read Models are
represented by green sticky notes that are placed within the Timeline
lane.  They are named views of the current state of domain entities,
e.g. "Ride" or "My Vehicles".
