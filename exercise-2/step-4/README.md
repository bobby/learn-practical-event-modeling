# Exercise 2, Step 4

The outcome of [the previous step](../step-3) was to connect our first
two types of slices, state change and state view, via arrows to
visualize the data flow.  We still have some gaps in this data flow,
which we'll identify in this step and address in the next.

The goal of this step is to identify the separate Streams of Events.
In our case, we have Events that pertain to Vehicles and their
availability, and then other Events that pertain to the lifecycle of a
particular Ride.

Separate these Events into separate horizontal lanes representing
Streams.
