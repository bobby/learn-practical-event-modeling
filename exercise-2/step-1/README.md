# Exercise 2, Step 1

The outcome of [Exercise 1](../../exercise-1) was a story board of our
system, e.g. the sequence of business Events with Interfaces
highlighting key moments of the user experience.

The goal of this step is to add in the Commands that will empower our
users to change the system.  Commands are represented by blue stickies
that are placed in the Timeline lane between the Interface where the
user invokes the Command and its resulting Event.  These commands are
named as verb phrases in the imperative, e.g. "Request Ride" or "Add
Vehicle".
